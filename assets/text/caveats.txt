### Caveats

This application is provided by the Welsh Government Data Science Unit and Input Output Analysis team to enable the analysis of third-party, single-region Input-Output tables. 

The application is supplied free of charge with no warranty or product support given or implied. Welsh Government does not guarantee the accuracy or reliability of any results obtained when using this application. 

Users should be aware that all economic modelling approaches have a number of limitations and should be used as a guide to understand how an economy may react subject to certain impacts. Moreover, this application provides estimates from the impacts of changes on economic demand. This is a form of partial equilibrium model, it is unable to provide a full system approach as changes in the structure of the supply side of the economy are not modelled. This has a number of important modelling implications and limitations. These include: 
* A linear relationship between inputs and output such that a X% increase in product or industry demand implies an X% increase in product supply. Thus, no economies or diseconomies of scale or price effects are modelled. 
* Goods and services are produced and provided using inputs with fixed proportions (and fixed relative prices). There is no factor substitution. This means any additional demand will be supplied relying on fixed (Cobb-Douglas) industry input proportions which come from the uploaded IOT data. 
* The proportion of labour inputs to new demand will also remain unchanged as demand changes. As prices and wages are also fixed, the returns to labour (and to taxes and other value added) will also remain constant. 
* Household consumption changes which come from within the model (such as that used to estimate the ‘Type 2’ multipliers), the nature and geographic location of household purchases also remains fixed, and changes are linear to changes in disposable wage income reported in the supply side of the model. 
* The ratio between regional and non-regional industry supply remains fixed irrespective of the size of any positive or negative shock. Therefore, very large demand increases will always be met by the region’s industrial supply, without any limits applied. 
* Input-Output modelling as provided does not allow for any form of maximisation over time. For example, it does not allow for current consumption to be altered to allow for potential changes in future consumption through changes to investment. 
* These conceptual and modelling limitations mean IO analysis should be viewed as indicative of the scale and industry-relative nature of the indirect effects of any economic shock. Given its fixed supply side, it might further be considered the maximum (modellable) impact of any such shock under specific scenarios. 

There are a number of considerations that are consequent on the above: 
* Economic, labour and environmental multipliers generated by the technique will generally overstate indirect impact, but by an unknown amount. 
* The approach works best when impacts are relatively small relative to the size of the relevant supplying industries (and their workforces). Large changes in economic demand (especially increases) will place productive demands on regional industries that they cannot supply, leading to either real-world price increases or substitution by imports that the model will not report. These effects will act to dampen the real (output) effect. 
* The potential for over-estimation are likely to be magnified when modelling small economies or sectors especially ones where specialist suppliers/services are absent. 
* Any inputs or resources which may be left under-used by a negative shock (such as labour) are assumed to remain unemployed rather than employed in other economic activities. Wage and input factor prices also are unable to respond accordingly. 
* The inability to model technological changes or other supply-side changes and adjustments in demand-side consumption (like other modelling approaches) means that the Input-Output analysis is not recommended in assessing medium- and long-term shocks and outcomes on an economy. 
* A range of models and techniques are recommended when modelling impacts on an economy. Each set of models have their own limitations which users should be aware of before using and these should be communicated alongside any results.
